# Onyx32

## Introduction

Onyx32 is a simple experimental Win32 wrapper written in C++ that is currently in development. It's intended to take advantage of newer C++ features. The project initially started as a means for me to learn newer C++ features while also exploring the Win32 API.

## Setting up

Development is best done in Visual Studio. You will need to have Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0 to build the project.

## Future features

The project is in need of some refactoring before I add any more features. At the moment, there are some code quality and architectural concerns I wish to address. Aftrewards, I intend to add support for the following:

* Custom Windows Win32 classes.
* Additional control support.
* Better support for owner drawn windows and controls.
* And more!
